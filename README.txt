This app is directed to providing a introductory AI experimentation lab.
It implements an AI that will match two inputs.
Code implements an AI that adapts to two inputs until they meet the reference value.
The reference value may be, for example, the sum, the product, the difference of the inputs.
It can print out the status (weights, current error, ...) of each step.
The final weights and reference value can be saved to a file to match new input pairs.
The AI structure is fully determined in a JSON file: config-basic1.jsn.
The config file is user editable.
